Processing file in small chunks
--------------------------------

Processing a complete file in single shots needs a lot of RAM,
So a better idea would be to process the data in chunks.

To do that a Shots mechanism is implemented,
which is controlled by a shell script **runshots.sh** kept in **scripts** directory.

To use shots mechanism copy the runshots.sh file in you build directory and run it by
providing following required arguements

. runshots.sh <Full data file path> <number of shots>

For e.g.
. runshots.sh ~/DevShare/test_PartialShield_Muon_11hrs56mins02secs_07Oct2021_Run77.root 4
